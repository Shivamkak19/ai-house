This Friday, we're excited to announce a very cool presentation‚Äîour very own Benjamin Lemkin (26') has discovered a clever methodology to jailbreak and circumvent the safety filters of GPT4! Join us at Frist 212, this Friday, March 29 at 4:45pm to hear Benjamin present and demonstrate his findings! As always, feel free to fill out RSVP for boba here. Presentation Description: LLMs are initially trained on vast amounts of data, then fine-tuned to provide appropriate and safe responses. I will discuss a novel method I found to manipulate the \"safe\" version of the model into losing its filter and creating innapropriate content. The exploit currently works for GPT4, Claude Sonnet, and (to some extent) for Inflection-2.5. Unlike other jailbreaks (for example, the popular \"Do Anything Now\" (DAN) ), the method does not rely on instructing the LLM to override its RLHF policy; instead, we cause the model to hallucinate using reversed text, which turns the model back into a word bucket, effectively pausing the model's filter. Our exploit shows a fundamental vulnerability in LLMs, as well as an opportunity to better understand the inner workings of LLMs during hallucinations.",

Apply ASAP as spots will fill up soon! ---- AI Risk 101 Workshop Beta Test (June 2-4) Hi! I‚Äôm Sydney and I‚Äôm running a pilot test of a free workshop in Berkeley, CA intended to introduce people to the fundamentals of AI risk. It will cover questions like: What kinds of capabilities might ML models develop? Will models be misused? What approaches exist to make ML models optimize for various goals? This workshop centers on existential risks that ML systems might pose ‚Äî ways in which models could permanently hurt the trajectory of humanity. We will try to be balanced in our presentations and focus on giving you tools to come to your own conclusions. But we can't escape the fact that we have our own opinions, and we aren't a representative group of people thinking about AI risk. Most of us are gravely worried about the risks that models pose ‚Äî that's why we're taking the time to help people think about it. We‚Äôll cover all costs associated with the workshop (travel, food, accommodations, etc). We‚Äôre passing around this document outlining the beta workshop around our circles because we don‚Äôt want to formally launch quite yet. Please feel free to pass the opportunity along to anyone you think might be interested, but don‚Äôt post it publicly on the internet quite yet. Apply here ASAP! Admissions are rolling. You‚Äôll hear back about your application within 3 days of applying. More info here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wjaJFnBy8yHBMUEv9yrd-dimFn3R58XeLO8bT2jkMHo/edit?usp=sharing",

For each of these tasks, I will give a brief summary of some recent methods, including a few of my own contributions. Bio: Kevin was born in Ireland, but grew up in England. He got his BA from U. Cambridge, his MEng from U. Pennsylvania, and his PhD from UC Berkeley. He then did a postdoc at MIT, and was an associate professor of computer science and statistics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, from 2004 to 2012. After getting tenure, he went to Google in California on his sabbatical and then ended up staying. He currently runs a team of 6 researchers inside of Google Brain; the team works on generative models, Bayesian inference, and various other topics. Kevin has published over 125 papers in refereed conferences and journals, as well 3 textbooks on machine learning published in 2012, 2022 and 2023 by MIT Press. (The 2012 book was awarded the DeGroot Prize for best book in the field of Statistical Science.) Kevin was also the (co) Editor-in-Chief of JMLR 2014--2017.",
